# Title 1

## \[A] Before the Examination season&#x20;

Before every examination season, centres should take the best precautions and measures to ensure that during the examination season and the dates leading up to and after it run as smoothly as possible. This section aims to give centres the regulations behind the preparation before examination seasons, and a generally chronological order of the events that should take place.&#x20;

### \[A.1] Registered centre license&#x20;

1. Every centre that is hosting an OEB qualification or examination must be a registered centre with a license granted by an official OEB Centre Inspector. These licenses will always have an expiry date which centres must renew before they host an OEB examination.&#x20;
2. For centres with a valid registered centre license:&#x20;
   1. Ensure that your license expiry date will last until at least a week after all examinations have been conducted and completed. A week is recommended as examinations could be re-scheduled due to unforeseen consequences, delays in the shipping of scripts, or other events.&#x20;
   2. If your centre’s license is all clear, then there is nothing to worry about. You should be able to request and receive all OEB examinations, qualifications or other related materials. Continue with the rest of this guide to ensure that your centre is best prepared for OEB examinations.&#x20;
3. For centres with invalid registered centre license:&#x20;
   1. If your centre’s license expiry date has passed, request for an OEB Inspection as soon as possible to renew your license. While OEB aims to ensure that all centres are licensed before examination seasons, if the request is received too late, it may not be possible. We recommend that centres request for license renewals and inspections at least a month in advance of their first examinations.&#x20;
   2. If your license is revoked by OEB, you may request to appeal the decision and have your license re-instated. However, to do this, you must either provide evidence that the revoking of the license was unnecessary or unfair or provide proof that the centre has been reformed to more adequately provide OEB examinations. You will then be required to have an OEB Inspector re-license the centre.&#x20;
4. For centres wanting to be registered:&#x20;
   1. Contact the OEB Centre Inspection Service about licensing your centre. You will undergo a series of inspections before you are awarded an OEB license.
   2. Before an inspection begins, you should ensure that your centre has the facilities and documentation, as well as other requirements, as stated in Sections \[A.2] and \[A.3] of the OEB Penal Code for Examination.
   3. Your inspection will likely be scheduled during a school day - during this inspection the head of centre or exams officer must accompany the OEB Inspector during the entire Inspection.
   4. Once the Inspector has reviewed all facilities, documentations and other requirements, your centre will be approved for a mock examination run using OEB sample and practice papers in various subjects.
   5. It is your job as the centre to begin preparing for these exams - we recommend that you use a sample of students and not an entire year. We recommend at least a third of the school population is chosen to sit the mock examination run.
   6. During this mock examination season, your centre will be obligated to follow all procedures and regulations under Title 1 of the OEB Penal Code for Examination, as well as any other appendages and regulations relevant to the centre within the OEB Penal Code for Examinations.
   7. Throughout the duration of the entire mock examination season, from the time of receiving the exam papers to shipping the exam papers for marking, an OEB Inspector must be present to oversee and evaluate the centre’s ability to conduct an OEB examination.
   8. Centres will almost always host written examinations, however non-exam assessments are where non-written exams can occur, in which case any centre will be notified at least a week before the inspection begins.
   9. Should a centre pass the mock examination season, they will be awarded an OEB centre license. Should a centre fail the mock examination season, they will have a second chance to pass the mock examination season or lose the opportunity for a license for 2 academic years.
5. If your centre license is to expire during the examination season, you must take the following precautions with immediate effect:
   1. Notify the OEB Inspection Service that you require a priority inspection and license renewal. Provide details on the date and time that the license will expire, during which examination(s) (if any occurs on the expiration date) it will expire within.
   2. Once this notice has been read and approved by OEB, your centre will receive a priority inspection to review all facilities and documentation within the facility. You must prepare your centre to the best of your ability to ensure that you pass the inspection.
   3. During the Inspection process, you must follow all procedures normally, as stipulated within articles 4b to 4h.
6. Registered centre licenses always follow a standard, unless explicitly stated by OEB. The standards are as followed:
   1. Within 3 days after the OEB inspection, a centre will officially receive a valid and active license to host all OEB examinations. This license will both be recorded on the OEB database and should be kept as a physical certificate within the school for review in future OEB inspections.
   2. Should you lose the physical copy of the license, you are required to request a new physical copy of the license from OEB before the next inspection.&#x20;
   3. It is not required to display the physical copy of the OEB license in public.
   4. All OEB licenses will not have a validity date that exceeds 3 years after the date they are issued. Any OEB License can range from 1 to 3 years. For centres that may require an exception to this rule, you are required to communicate this to the OEB Inspection Service.
   5. All centre licenses expire at 00:00 UTC of the expiration date regardless of the time the license was issued.
   6. Centres with a license that has less than 3 years of validity may require a special extension instead of a license renewal by contacting the OEB Inspection Service.
7. The following scenarios can invalidate any centre’s license:
   1. Reaching the expiration date for any license, with the expiration time being stated in Article 6e.
   2. Degradation of any facilities and standards for hosting OEB examinations within the centre that has been reported by other individuals or noticed by an Inspector.
   3. Any attempt to hide or “cover up” any acts of maladministration or malpractice, or any other attempts to deceive OEB inspectors.
   4. OEB reserves the rights to revoke the centre licenses from any centre, with at least a 5 days notice in advance, at any time or date, for any reason.

### \[A.2] Appropriate Facilities

1. For any centre wanting to conduct an OEB examination, you are required to have these basic facilities and meet the minimum requirements for each facility.

* Secure storage room for question papers and other examination materials
* Secure storage room to separately handle and store candidate electronic items or other personal possessions during the exam
* At least one major room, or multiple rooms, to be able to conduct the exam

2. Minimum requirements for secure storage room for question papers:
   1. The secure storage room must have the capacity to store all question papers and all completed candidate scripts for the entire examination season. To store these materials, you are required to have wardrobes, closets or other similar storage devices to store these materials. All storage devices must be completely opaque.
   2. Each closet within the secure storage room must be protected by a lock or or other methods described in Article 2c below.

   3. Storage devices must have metal bars or heavy duty metal netting/meshing within the interior walls of the storage device, similar to that they may be used to line a wall as mentioned in Article 2k.
   4. All storage must use heavy duty bolts, nails or other mechanisms to securely bolt all storage devices used to hold examination materials either to the floor or walls. Alternatively, you may use metal meshing/netting to “trap” the storage device.
   5. The secure storage room should have only one entrance/exit, and the door must be locked either by keycard, biometric, lock and key or any other approved method by the OEB Inspection service.
   6. The door to the secure storage room should be fire proof. It should be able to withstand any burns or heat of up to 150 degrees celsius. The door may not have a window or any other form of viewing instrument, and must be completely opaque. The inside and outside section of the door should be covered in 2cm thick metal sheeting.
   7. There should be no windows, or any other viewing instrument that would allow anyone to see into the room. Rooms are permitted to have one way glass to see out of the room, but you may not see into the room.
   8. Rooms that do not have one-way windows or glass can either choose between the following options: removing the windows and instead replacing them with walls, or using roll down metal shutters with permission from the OEB Inspection Service..
   9. There should be a physical or digital log of individuals entering and exiting the secure storage room, with the date and time, and reason for entry. All individuals are required to fill out this log each time they enter the room.
   10. Any question papers within the room must be sealed in thick opaque packaging, that does not allow people to see through them to view the question paper. All packaging must be appropriately sealed using sellotape.
   11. The walls of the secure storage room must be at least 20cm thick, with no cracks, holes or other potential instability to the walls.&#x20;
   12. Every room is to have the walls lined with heavy duty metal sheeting of a minimum of 2cm thickness at all exterior walls of the secure storage room. It is not required to have this in any interior walls, pillars or other building related structures located entirely within the secure storage room. Secure storage rooms are also required to have additional heavy duty metal netting/meshing in the interior of the metal sheeting.
   13. Secure storage rooms may not have fuse boxes, electrical outputs, exposed wires or any other electrical component or electrical powered materials that may require external teams to repair or monitor, or that may damage question papers or their packaging.
   14. Secure storage rooms may not have any pipes, water inlets, water outlets or anything that may be used to transfer liquid or assist in the input or output of liquid, primarily to avoid damage to question papers and their packaging.
   15. The only electrical powered items a secure storage room is permitted to have is the necessary amount of light bulbs and other illumination devices to be able to see clearly and visibly within the secure storage room.
   16. All secure storage rooms are to be equipped with a burglar alarm or some form of unauthorised motion sensor detector. It is up to a centre on whether this triggers a loud alarm within the room or a silent alarm that is able to alert centre staff. Once the alarm has been triggered, the door should automatically shut and lock, and can only be opened by authorisation from outside the door.
   17. Every room is required to have a camera that is appropriately digitally secure. The camera is only to be used to monitor the room and ensure that no unauthorised persons enter the secure storage room or damage occurs to the question papers and their packets
   18. All cameras within the secure storage room must have full visibility into everything in the room, and may only be accessed or used by individuals with the standard authorisation to enter the secure storage room. If possible, disassociate your camera from the rest of the building’s security network or have it protected by additional authentication.
3. All registered centres must have an official system or storage room for the handling of all electronic items or unauthorised materials. This room must be sufficiently secure to safeguard candidate property, as well as to appropriately store the unauthorised materials.
   1. Every registered centre is required to have at least one of these rooms present within their own property.
   2. The room in question must be able to sufficiently store all candidate unauthorised materials, while having spaces for walking or roaming within the room. A registered centre may choose to have multiple of these rooms, in which case each individual room must meet the stated prerequisites and regulations.
   3. For the handling of electronic items, you are to follow articles 3d to 3n as listed below.
   4. All candidates reserve the right to have at least one “wallet” or “storage medium” dedicated to the storage of their own personal electronic items before an examination begins. Each storage medium must be storable within the contraband storage room and must be appropriate for the storage of electronic items.&#x20;
   5. Each storage medium is to be assigned a unique number, starting from “1” until “9999”, in which the storage mediums must begin with “A” then the number “1” until “9999” and so on for the rest of the alphabet.
   6. Each storage medium is to have an assigned ticket corresponding to the storage medium’s assigned unique number - this ticket is to be stored within the storage medium and will be used later by invigilators and candidates for re-distribution of contraband.
   7. Invigilators should set up an area for candidates to be able to hand in their electronic items in an orderly manner, for example a line where candidates may line up to put their electronic items in the centre’s chosen storage medium.
   8. Invigilators are responsible for ensuring that when a candidate is handing in their electronic items, that the candidate is handing in all electronic items in addition to other contraband that may be appropriately stored within the storage medium.
   9. Invigilators are responsible for ensuring that the ticket assigned to each storage medium is given to the candidate so that they may identify in which storage medium their contraband is in, and to prevent candidates from potentially committing theft by taking another candidate’s item in another storage medium.
   10. Invigilators are to ensure that once a candidate has stored their contraband in the storage medium and received the relevant ticket, the storage medium is either prepared for transport or immediately transported to the designated secure storage room.
   11. During the transportation of the storage mediums, invigilators should take care in taking the shortest or fastest possible route to the contraband storage room. Once the storage mediums have been appropriately stored and secured within the contraband storage room, the room is to be locked and also appropriately secured if necessary.
   12. In the final five minutes of an examination, contraband items in their storage mediums may be brought up for collection by candidates only once the examination is over and candidates are being dismissed.
   13. To collect their items, candidates must present their ticket relevant to the storage medium in which their possessions have been stored in - invigilators must verify the validity of the ticket and allow the candidate to collect their possessions from the relevant storage medium.
   14. Once a storage medium has been collected from, it is to be prepared for transport and storage or immediately transported to the contraband storage room so invigilators may collect the storage mediums for future contraband handling.
   15. For the handling of esoteric or miscellaneous contraband items, follow articles 3p to 3#:
   16. Misceallaneous contraband items may be stored using the same storage medium for a candidate's electronic items.
   17. If not possible, an miscellaneous contraband item may be stored in a second storage medium and the candidate is to be issued a second corresponding ticket to the storage medium to be able to claim the items after the examination.
   18. If the contraband item is unable to fit in a storage medium, and it is possible to "split it up", then you may store the contraband item as such, ensuring that the candidate is issued the corresponding ticket for each storage medium used.
   19. If it is still not possible to store a contraband item within a storage medium, you may label or tag the contraband item with a number corresponding to a ticket, and issue the candidate the corresponding ticket to be able to claim later.
   20. Contraband items are to be transported and stored in the same manner as electronic materials, candidates may not receive their contraband items until the examination has been finished and they have been dismissed.
   21. For other regulations regarding personal contraband items of candidates:
   22. Malpractice or maladministration involving either collected or uncollected contraband items must have photographic evidence of the contraband used, and if possible, the manner in which the contraband item was used. The evidence in question may be a photograph or video evidence.
4. All registered centres are required to have the appropriate size and number of examination halls to sufficiently conduct all examinations for every candidate within their centre.
