# Title 1

## \[A] Before the Examination season&#x20;

Before every examination season, centres should take the best precautions and measures to ensure that during the examination season and the dates leading up to and after it run as smoothly as possible. This section aims to give centres the regulations behind the preparation before examination seasons, and a generally chronological order of the events that should take place.&#x20;

### \[A.1] Registered centre license&#x20;

1. Every centre that is hosting an OEB qualification or examination must be a registered centre with a license granted by an official OEB Centre Inspector. These licenses will always have an expiry date which centres must renew before they host an OEB examination.&#x20;
2. For centres with a valid registered centre license:&#x20;
   1. Ensure that your license expiry date will last until at least a week after all examinations have been conducted and completed. A week is recommended as examinations could be re-scheduled due to unforeseen consequences, delays in the shipping of scripts, or other events.&#x20;
   2. If your centre’s license is all clear, then there is nothing to worry about. You should be able to request and receive all OEB examinations, qualifications or other related materials. Continue with the rest of this guide to ensure that your centre is best prepared for OEB examinations.&#x20;
3. For centres with invalid registered centre license:&#x20;
   1. If your centre’s license expiry date has passed, request for an OEB Inspection as soon as possible to renew your license. While OEB aims to ensure that all centres are licensed before examination seasons, if the request is received too late, it may not be possible. We recommend that centres request for license renewals and inspections at least a month in advance of their first examinations.&#x20;
   2. If your license is revoked by OEB, you may request to appeal the decision and have your license re-instated. However, to do this, you must either provide evidence that the revoking of the license was unnecessary or unfair or provide proof that the centre has been reformed to more adequately provide OEB examinations. You will then be required to have an OEB Inspector re-license the centre.&#x20;
4. For centres wanting to be registered:&#x20;
   1. Contact the OEB Centre Inspection Service about licensing your centre. You will undergo a series of inspections before you are awarded an OEB license.
   2. Before an inspection begins, you should ensure that your centre has the facilities and documentation, as well as other requirements, as stated in Chapter 1 Sections \[A.2] and \[A.3] of the OEB Penal Code for Examination.
   3. Your inspection will likely be scheduled during a school day - during this inspection the head of centre or exams officer must accompany the OEB Inspector during the entire Inspection.
   4. Once the Inspector has reviewed all facilities, documentations and other requirements, your centre will be approved for a mock examination run using OEB sample and practice papers in various subjects.
   5. It is your job as the centre to begin preparing for these exams - we recommend that you use a sample of students and not an entire year. We recommend at least a third of the school population is chosen to sit the mock examination run.
   6. During this mock examination season, your centre will be obligated to follow all procedures and regulations under Chapter 1 of the OEB Penal Code for Examination, as well as any other appendages and regulations relevant to the centre within the OEB Penal Code for Examinations.
   7. Throughout the duration of the entire mock examination season, from the time of receiving the exam papers to shipping the exam papers for marking, an OEB Inspector must be present to oversee and evaluate the centre’s ability to conduct an OEB examination.
   8. Centres will almost always host written examinations, however non-exam assessments are where non-written exams can occur, in which case any centre will be notified at least a week before the inspection begins.
   9. Should a centre pass the mock examination season, they will be awarded an OEB centre license. Should a centre fail the mock examination season, they will have a second chance to pass the mock examination season or lose the opportunity for a license for 2 academic years.
5. If your centre license is to expire during the examination season, you must take the following precautions with immediate effect:
   1. Notify the OEB Inspection Service that you require a priority inspection and license renewal. Provide details on the date and time that the license will expire, during which examination(s) (if any occurs on the expiration date) it will expire within.
   2. Once this notice has been read and approved by OEB, your centre will receive a priority inspection to review all facilities and documentation within the facility. You must prepare your centre to the best of your ability to ensure that you pass the inspection.
   3. During the Inspection process, you must follow all procedures normally, as stipulated within articles 4b to 4h.
6. Registered centre licenses always follow a standard, unless explicitly stated by OEB. The standards are as followed:
   1. Within 3 days after the OEB inspection, a centre will officially receive a valid and active license to host all OEB examinations. This license will both be recorded on the OEB database and should be kept as a physical certificate within the school for review in future OEB inspections.
   2. Should you lose the physical copy of the license, you are required to request a new physical copy of the license from OEB before the next inspection.&#x20;
   3. It is not required to display the physical copy of the OEB license in public.
   4. All OEB licenses will not have a validity date that exceeds 3 years after the date they are issued. Any OEB License can range from 1 to 3 years. For centres that may require an exception to this rule, you are required to communicate this to the OEB Inspection Service.
   5. All centre licenses expire at 00:00 UTC of the expiration date regardless of the time the license was issued.
   6. Centres with a license that has less than 3 years of validity may require a special extension instead of a license renewal by contacting the OEB Inspection Service.
7. The following scenarios can invalidate any centre’s license:
   1. Reaching the expiration date for any license, with the expiration time being stated in Article 6e of this chapter.
   2. Degradation of any facilities and standards for hosting OEB examinations within the centre that has been reported by other individuals or noticed by an Inspector.
   3. Any attempt to hide or “cover up” any acts of maladministration or malpractice, or any other attempts to deceive OEB inspectors.
   4. OEB reserves the rights to revoke the centre licenses from any centre, with at least a 5 days notice in advance, at any time or date, for any reason.
