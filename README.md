The OMEGA Examination Board Penal Code, or OEB Penal Code for short, is the official group of legislative documents governing all qualifications and organs within the board. It outlines strict regulations, standards and policies that all candidates and board staff must follow during the designated appropriate times for the penal code to be in effect. Enforcement is managed by the Office of Legislation Enforcement, and sentencing and punishment is managed by the Office of Qualification Integrity.
